# Hotaru-Project-install-full 

This installation is done for Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ (In fact, even if this version of Raspberry pi is the newest in model3, it took long time)
With some sort of upgrade or changes, it might be error to install in Raspberry pi 4
In this case it needs to be changed

Also would like to mention this is a personal memo 
So this read me includes many info that is not related to actual installation
